Graph generation:

- Step 1: Generate a DAG
    - Connect all nodes without returning to nodes already visited
        - Extract a sub-array of possible nodes to connect randomly to current node
    - If all nodes are already connected to the graph, stop iteration and start step 2
- Step 2: Visit all nodes that aren't root
    - On each node:
        - Retrieve all nodes that doesn't have a path to current node
        - Retrieve all nodes that have a direct path from current node (direct edge connection)
        - Extract list with possible nodes of the graph that aren't on the previous 2 conditions
            - Extract a sub-array of possible nodes to connect randomly to current node

Weight generation:
    - Is randomly generated an integer value between -10 and 10
    - When adding an edge, the value is then linked to that edge
